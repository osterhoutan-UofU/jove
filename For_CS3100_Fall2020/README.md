* -------------------------------------------------------

* Week-1 **Reading**: Chapters 1, 2, 3. __Outcomes:__
  Emerge with complete understanding of the basics of
  computability, why studying formal language matters, and know how to construct
  languages using set operations, concatenation, and exponentiation. They also
  begin studying Kleene-star. As for practical matters, they understand the course
  objectives, how to run the course software and submit the required material for
  grades.

* Week-2 **Reading**: Chapters 3, 4 (except 4.6 thru 4.8), 5, 6. __Outcomes:__
  Finish understanding Kleene-star, and are able to design
  DFA using two methods: By knowing how to encode salient information in DFA states
  (by naming DFA states to retain this info) and by Boolean operations on DFA (union,
  intersection, complement). They know how to document DFA using literate-programming
  methods of annotating comments within a simple DFA markdown. They are able to
  automatically build, and test DFA, following important principles of software testing.

* Week-3 **Reading** Chapter 6 (skip 6.4 and 6.5), 7.  __Outcomes:__
Outcomes: Understand the importance of nondeterminism in computer
  science, and what nondeterministic finite-state automata are. They understand how to
  convert NFA to DFA via subset construction. They are able to witness, through actual
  hands-on activity, that NFA can blow up exponentially when converted to DFA. They
  may also obtain a DFA directly, and check against results from NFA2DFA using a
  DFA graph isomorphism check, thus showing the power of the Myhill-Nerode theorem to
  help check one software construction method against the other, to catch bugs.

* -------------------------------------------------------
   

* Begin by running the notebook in 00_Overview_Of_CS3100_Fall2020/. Then start with the remaining directories such as
01_Computability_Languages/, 02_Basic_DFA/, etc.

* This is a directory prepared for the CS 3100, Fall 2020 students.

* It contains a description of how various Jove modules will be
  covered in our lectures.
  
* I'll now straight present the syllabus and the schedule of
  lectures. 
  
  - All Quizzes will be assigned on Canvas:
  
    - They are given out before a PAIR of lectures (occurring in a week).
    
    - They must be solved and submitted the same week Friday 11:59pm.
    
  - All our Assignments will be provided via Jove notebooks, with a PDF
    summarizing them as well. The PDF is kept on Canvas.
  
  - All our Exams (MT-1, MT-2 and Finals) will be given on Canvas.

  - **Practice problems** for the exams will be assigned each week, 
    but won't be graded. These will help you study for the exams
    in an incremental fashion. Find the Practice Problems on Canvas.

* CS 3100 is running in a *FLIPPED CLASS* style.

* You MUST run each Jove notebook mentioned below *BEFORE* you come
  to a lecture. These notebooks contain a video recording PLUS practice
  material for you.
  
* Some notebooks will last across multiple lectures, and some lectures
  will involve multiple notebooks.
  
* Assignments are to be turned in as finished Jove notebooks. There may
  also be uploads of other files, as specified.

* Each question of an assignment will be in a separate ".ipynb" Jove file.

* In some cases, we will allow documents to be scanned and uploaded as PDF. We require
  you to be using Adobe Scan - a free app you can get for iPhone or Android.

* For more info, see the PDF documents on Canvas that describe our course policies.


* -----------------------------------------------------------------

* **SYLLABUS** is as follows (if I write `` 1:8/25 '' it means Lec1 on 8/25, and so on)
* Some of the chapters are read across multiple weeks.
